## Datahub Content Management System repository

The repository is split by datahub pages, and each page folder contains the narratives and refrence files used by that page.
This should make it easier for analysts to change datahub narratives and refrence file data easily on a per page basis.

You will find that refrence data that can be autogenerated from underlaying tables in the data ware house will now reside with in the Data warehouse.
